# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created to be a study resource for boot camp students to refernce as they complete their prework. In building this guide I was able to learn basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
The guide is a simple yet informative webpage meant to give fellow boot camp students important notes on the various topics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

Alternatively you can right click anywhere on the page and select the inspect option.
A console panel should open below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on what topic to study first.
